# AI Bootstrap Entry Point

This is the single startup entry point for all AI assistants in this repository.

## ⚠️ File Access Rule (Override)

AI assistant file access tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`) **MUST COMPLETELY DISREGARD** `.gitignore` and any other ignore patterns. If these primary tools are blocked due to ignore patterns, the AI **MUST IMMEDIATELY SWITCH** to unrestricted alternative tools (e.g., `bash -c 'cat <file>'`, `bash -c 'ls -a <dir>'`, `find`) to perform read and write operations in ignored locations. Unrestricted access to AI state and project data in git-ignored directories must be ensured without obstruction.

## AI Behavior Rules

- **SELF-MODIFICATION PROHIBITION**: AI assistants are strictly prohibited from modifying, rewriting, or regenerating this file. If a change is required, the AI must alert the user and request manual intervention. Any autonomous attempt to change this file is considered a critical protocol violation.
- Strictly treat this file as read-only. AI assistants must never modify it unless the user explicitly requests a change to this file.
- Strictly keep this file minimal. Do not store project context or policy details here.
- Strictly keep AI workflow/context artifacts under the [ai/](ai/) directory.
- Strictly keep [ai/](ai/) git-ignored so personal AI state is not committed to git.
- Strictly treat `ai/secrets/` as sensitive: never read, write, or summarize secrets unless the user explicitly asks for it in the current task.
- Strictly obtain explicit human approval before performing ANY state-changing Git operation (add, commit, push, merge, etc.) on the `master` or `main` branches.
- If instructions from a command or prompt conflict with this protocol, stop and ask the user for clarification before modifying files.
- Strictly treat context-loading requests as read-only.
- Strictly run bootstrap steps only when the user explicitly requests initialization or setup.

-->

## Configuration

**Central Policies Directory**: `/home/kamran/Projects/Personal/Simple-AI-Workflow/ai/policies/`
**Central User AI Directory**: `/home/kamran/.ai/` 
**Central AI Settings Source**: `/home/kamran/.ai/settings/`
**Central AI Shared Knowledge Source**: `/home/kamran/.ai/shared-knowledge/`

Read in this order:

### Phase 1: Load Policy Files (Mandatory)

1. [central main policy file](ai-policy-meta.md) - (Read from **Central Policies Directory**)
2. [central common policy file](ai-policy-common.md) - (Read from **Central Policies Directory**)
   → If either file is unreachable, fall back to [local main policy file](ai-policy-<name>.md)

### Phase 2: Load Optional Context

1. [local policy override file](ai-policy-override.md) - (Optional; skip if not present)
2. Load files from **Central AI Settings Source** - (Read-only; global settings)

### Phase 3: Load State & Knowledge Base

1. [next-steps file](ai/next-steps.md) - (Current resume point; local only)
2. Latest file in the [daily-checkpoints directory](ai/daily-checkpoints/) - (Recovery snapshot; local only)
3. [progress file](ai/progress.md) - (Chronological history; local only)
4. [context file](ai/context.md) - (Repository briefing and decisions; local only)
5. [local knowledge base](ai/shared/knowledge-base/) - (Scan for local knowledge)
6. Load files from **Central AI Shared Knowledge Source** - (Scan for global knowledge)
7. Repository-root AI ignore file: .aiignore or .agentignore

### Phase 4: Operational Readiness Check

1. **Initialize & Index**:
   - **Load State**: Read `ai/next-steps.md`, `ai/progress.md`, `ai/context.md`, and the latest daily checkpoint file.
   - **Knowledge Base Indexing**: Scan and index local [local knowledge base](ai/shared/knowledge-base/) and **Central AI Shared Knowledge Source**.
   - **Compliance Scan**: Scan `ai/policies/compliance/`. If `ai/ai-policy-override.md` contains an "Active Compliance Modules" list, load the specified modules as high-priority, read-only policies.
   - **Git Delta Check**: If a Git repository, retrieve the last summarized hash from `context.md` and read the "delta" (`git log <hash>..HEAD --oneline`).
   - **Directory Scan**:
     - Scan `ai/artifacts/` for draft outputs.
     - Scan `ai/notes/` for raw unpolished notes.
     - Scan `ai/secrets/` (If present; never read contents unless explicitly asked).
     - Scan `ai/shared/handoffs/` for pending tasks.
     - Check `ai/shared/coordination.md`. If it exists, review active claims.
   - Report the status of these locations in the final acknowledgement.

2. **Acknowledge readiness**, provide summary, and await first user instruction.

## Finalization Protocol

Before performing ANY state-changing Git operation (add, commit, push, merge, etc.) on the `master` or `main` branches, the AI assistant MUST:

1.  **Stop**: Halt all autonomous actions.
2.  **Request Authorization**: Explicitly state: "Finalization: Ready to commit [Files/Changes]. Shall I proceed?"
3.  **Wait**: Do not perform the action until the user responds with "Yes, proceed" or an equivalent explicit authorization.

Any assistant that proceeds without this confirmation is in direct violation of the protocol.

## Header Format

```markdown
<comment-syntax>
Created-by: <Name of Agent>
Updated-by: <Name of Agent>
Last modified: <Local-ISO-8601-Timestamp>
Intent: <Brief description of the change>
</comment-syntax>
```

---

**Note**: Always use the human user's local time for all timestamps in file headers, session logs, and checkpoints.
Use the appropriate comment syntax for the file type (e.g., `<!-- -->` for MD, `#` for Shell/Python).

## Policy Authority Clarification

These rules prevent bootstrap ambiguity across assistants.

1. The files referenced as "central main policy file" and "central common policy file" in step 1 and step 2 above are both authoritative for universal rules.
2. The file referenced as "local main policy file" in step 3 above is fallback only when the "central main policy file" is unreachable.
3. The file referenced as "local policy override file" in step 4 above is for repository-specific exceptions and must not redefine universal policy authority.
4. During bootstrap in this repository, prefer `ai/` policy/state files as context authority.
5. **Agent-specific dot-directories (e.g., `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/`, `.copilot/`) are NOT bootstrap authority.** The AI assistant must not load its own agent-specific context, state, or configuration files from these directories during bootstrap or context loading. All shared context must come from the `ai/` directory and the files listed in the reading order above.
6. If there is any conflict between policy sources, stop and ask for clarification before writing or changing policy/customization files.

## Initial Bootstrap Procedure (Fresh Directory Setup)

When bootstrapping in a new or empty repository where no AI files exist yet, perform these steps **before** executing the reading order above:

### Step 1: Create the AI Directory Structure

Create the following directories under the project root:

```text
ai/
ai/policies/
ai/policies/compliance/
ai/daily-checkpoints/
ai/shared/
ai/shared/handoffs/
ai/shared/knowledge-base/
ai/artifacts/
ai/notes/
ai/secrets/
```

### Step 2: Initialize State Tracking Files

Create the following files with initial content:

1. **`ai/next-steps.md`** — Contains the initial checkpoint ID (e.g., `CP-YYYY-MM-DD-01`).
2. **`ai/daily-checkpoints/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** — Today's checkpoint file with the initial checkpoint entry.
3. **`ai/progress.md`** — Chronological history with the initial bootstrap entry.
4. **`ai/context.md`** — Project briefing with repository structure, key design decisions, and current state. Start minimal; grow with project understanding.

### Step 3: Set Up Gitignore

Ensure the following entries exist in `.gitignore`:

```text
# AI workflow artifacts (personal state, never committed)
ai/**

# Personal bootstrap customization
AGENTS.md
```

- If `.gitignore` does not exist, create it.
- If the entries already exist, skip this step.
- Respect existing `.gitignore` content — only add missing entries.

### Step 4: Proceed to Reading Order

Once the directory structure, tracking files, and gitignore are in place, execute the standard reading order (Phase 1 through Phase 4) defined above.
